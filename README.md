# Shib Jobs BOT

## Requirements
In order to to run this bot you'll need:

 - NodeJS

## Deployment

Having your repository ready, run:

    npm install

That command will download all the libraries the project needs. If you don't have NodeJS installed, take a look at: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04

Now you'll need to modify the *config.example.json* file to just *config.json* with the proper information.

Enjoy!
